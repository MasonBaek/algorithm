# algorithm


<h2>:cool: having fun playing algorithm sometime put me sick tho</h2>
I started with "Hello world" as everybody has done it.
since then on system console always(99%) talks to me "you wrong".:fearful:

ans also make me have a desire to solve problems step by step 
quite satisfied :laughing:

now finally playing with keyboard and Eclipse changed my working field.
I'm still learning JSP, JAVA, Python, Oracle, MySql, html, CSS

i am going to put some keyboard work that i have been through.
especially algorithm solution.
